<p> 
We are influenced by Buddhism, but not Buddhist in a religious sense. We are affiliated with the <a href="http://secularbuddhism.org/">Secular Buddhist Association</a>.
We don't take anything in Buddhism on faith, certainly not rebirth,
but not even views that are valid withinn a naturalistic sense, like the view that one should love everyone without exception.  
We apply critical thinking and the filter of reason to everything.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
Although myth, tradition and metaphor has it that the heart is what makes us love, the best scientific research shows that we love with our brains.

<p> 
Loving-kindness is the feeling of love in a non-romantic or non-sexual sense. 
It is associated with a circuit in the brain that produces a chemical called oxytocin.
Non-romantic love is the feeling a parent has for a child, or that people sometimes have for for their fellow citizens or for all of humanity.
Romantic love also involves this oxytocin circuit, but includes the extra element of sexual attraction. 
</p> 

<p> 
Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to what ever is going on in the present moment, with an attitude that is at least
neutral if not benevolent, friendly and loving. Mindfulness is something that you can do at every waking moment. It is perhaps
easiest to be mindful when you are either sitting quietly or engaging in simple manual labor (like washing dishes, raking, etc.). But 
you can be mindful even while engaged in thought, by being <em>aware that you are thinking</em> at this very moment.
</p> 


<p> 
Sometimes the words "mindfulness meditation" are used together, which can be a little confusing. 
We use the word "meditation" to refer to a formal practice, such as sitting quietly for 20 minutes while paying attention to the breath. 
We use "mindfulness" to refer to the practice of paying attention to what is going at at present at any moment throughout the day.
</p>
<p>
Meditation is a good way to prepare to become mindful. Meditation 
quiets the inner dialogue that pulls one out of the present and into ruminations about the past or anxieties about the future.
Therefore, at the conclusion of a meditation, one typically emerges in a mindful state that is naturally focused on the present
with acceptance and equanimity.
